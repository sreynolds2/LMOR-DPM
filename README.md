# LMOR-PS-DPM

## Description
This repository defines a pallid sturgeon demographic population model.  This model is:

- age based 
- has both deterministic and multiple stochastic versions
- associated with a matrix model

It is parameterized for the population of pallid sturgeon residing in the Lower Missouri River from below Gavins Point Dam down to the confluence with the Mississippi River (LMOR).

## Objectives
This model was designed to: 

1. Analyze the population trends of LMOR PS given:
    a. no management actions
    b. removal of harvest
    c. various stocking strategies

2. Analyze the magnitude of age-0 survival needed for population growth under various model assumptions. 

3. Be the base model for projecting population dynamics assuming additional management actions (e.g., IRC construction).
