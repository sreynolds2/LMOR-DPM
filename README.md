# LMOR-PS-DPM

## Description
This repository defines a pallid sturgeon demographic population model.  This model is (TBD):

- age/stage based 
- deterministic/stochastic
- matrix/IBM/combo

It is parameterized for the population of pallid sturgeon residing in the Lower Missouri River from below Gavins Point Dam down to the confluence with the Mississippi River (LMOR).

## Objectives
This model was designed to: 

1. Analyze the population trends of LMOR PS given:
    a. no management actions
    b. removal of harvest
    c. various stocking strategies

2. Analyze the magnitude of age-0 survival needed for population growth under various model assumptions.
